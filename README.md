# jikken_kyoiku
A website to test my ability to imploy different code.

Will do things like adding auth with JWT, OAuth, even my own handmade auth; will push different ideas/projects into their own branch and will merge the best/most attractive (to a 3rd party) into the main.

This site itself is just the base layer for all my other ideas though. The site itselft means nothing without these other (later) additions.
