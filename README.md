# jikken_kyoiku
A website to test my ability to imploy different code.

Will do things like adding auth with JWT, OAuth, even my own handmade auth; will push different ideas/projects into their own branch and will merge the best/most attractive (to a 3rd party) into the main.

This site itself is just the base layer for all my other ideas though. The site itselft means nothing without these other (later) additions.

This website WILL create EVERYTHING from scratch, no npm, no 3rd party plugins, nothing. I might change that at a later date to test something like logrocket, or include a framework, etc..

The server side will be a little bit more liberal because of the nature of JS webservers. I may end up even writing in another language like Rust, but I would like to sharpen my js server skills before I forge my skills in Rust (javascript also pays more so thats something to take into account).
